AJAX: Asynchronous Javascript And XML.

XML is a light format used to send data from a server to a browser, 
from a server to another server, etc.

Jason is another commonly used format to send data.

To use this data received from a server in a specific format, we 
need to parse it into Javascript usable code.

Basic async operation method:
setTimeout(callBackFunct, numbMiliseconds); 

setTimeout(() => {
	// call back func code goes here
}, numbMiliseconds); 

All the code that we write inside the callback function is going to 
be asynchronous and is going to wait the numbMiliseconds specified 
before starting to run.

The program continues running the script until it receives a response 
from the asynchronous method.

A promise is an object that gives back a result of an asynchronous 
operation or a failure of an asynchronous operation.

Adding AsyncAwait doesn't change anything in the background, we are 
still working with promises, but it is an even easier syntax to write.
